### Data Cleaning and Preparations

In the initial phase of the data cleaning and preparations, the following actions were performed on the different technologies used;

#### Excel
  1. Data loading and inspection
  2. Handling missing and null variables using ISBLANK function in Excel
  3. Eliminating duplicates.
  4. Data cleaning and formatting.

#### SQL
  1. The already cleaned data from Excel was converted to a CSV file format, which enabled the data to be imported into SQL quickly and efficiently as opposed to directly importing an Excel file format.
  2. Creation of a database.

      ```SQL
          CREATE DATABASE LITA_PROJECT
      ```

     The above code creates a database that houses all tables ready for querying.
     
  4. Import the SalesData and CustomerData data into the already created database.
  5. Writing amazing codes to show the different trends and patterns in the dataset for making sound decisions (screenshot of the codes).

#### POWER BI
  1. launched the power bi environment.
  2. Importation of both datasets using the TEXT/CSV file extension.
  3. Explored and cleaned the dataset.
  4. Confirmed the integrity of the datasets by using column quality, column distribution, and column profile options under the view tab(screenshot of this).

### Recommendations  for Customer Subscription Data

Enhance the Basic Subscription Offering: Since the Basic subscription is the most popular, consider enhancing its features or benefits to increase customer satisfaction and retention. This could include exclusive discounts, early access to new collections, or personalized recommendations.

Targeted Retention Strategies: It's crucial to analyze the reasons behind cancellations, with nearly half of the subscriptions being cancelled.  Proactive customer feedback mechanisms should be Implemented to identify pain points and address them promptly. Also, targeted re-engagement campaigns for those who have cancelled should be Considered.

Segmented Marketing Efforts: Utilize customer segmentation based on region and subscription type to tailor marketing messages. Personalized campaigns can increase engagement and conversion rates, especially for those in the Basic subscription tier.

Data-Driven Decision Making: Continuously analyze customer data to track trends over time. Regular monitoring of subscription metrics will enable the brand to make informed decisions about inventory, product offerings, and promotional strategies.

Loyalty Programs: Introduce loyalty programs that reward long-term subscribers, encouraging them to stay with the brand and reducing churn rates.

By focusing on these strategies, the brand can enhance customer loyalty, improve subscription retention, and ultimately drive revenue growth.
